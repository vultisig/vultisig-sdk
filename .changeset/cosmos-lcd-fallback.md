## Fixed

- Cosmos account info LCD fallback for extended account types that StargateClient cannot decode (vesting wrappers, module accounts) — prevents doomed txs with `sequence:0` that fail at broadcast with `account sequence mismatch, expected N, got 0` (#579)
- Cosmos coin balance LCD fallback when StargateClient returns `amount:"0"` on a funded address — fixes a packaging-level discrepancy in cosmjs's HTTP layer under Hermes/React Native that silently surfaced as "you have 0" on funded Terra/TerraClassic wallets (#579)
