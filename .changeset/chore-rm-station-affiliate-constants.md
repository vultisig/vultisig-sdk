chore: remove Station affiliate constants from shared SDK (closes #536)

Station-specific constants (`stvs` THORName, `0x649E...076D` EVM fee receiver) do not belong in a public package consumed by Windows and external users. The generic `affiliateConfig` injection seam on `findSwapQuote` + `SwapAffiliateConfig` type remain — those are correct SDK design. Station reconstructs the same three configs in its own consumer package (mcp-ts#201).

**BREAKING CHANGE:** `stationKyberSwapAffiliateConfig`, `stationNativeSwapAffiliateConfig`, and `stationOneInchAffiliateConfig` are no longer exported from `@vultisig/sdk`. See MIGRATING.md for the reconstruction pattern.

> **WARNING: DO NOT MERGE until vultisig/mcp-ts#201 lands.** Station must reconstruct these constants in its consumer package before this removal ships. Merging early will silently fall back to vultisig-0 affiliate defaults, breaking Station's affiliate fee routing on native swaps.
