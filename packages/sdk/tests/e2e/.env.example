# E2E Test Vault Configuration
# ===============================
#
# SECURITY WARNING: Never commit the actual .env file to git!
# The .env file is git-ignored to prevent accidentally exposing vault credentials.
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env in the same directory: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Fill in your test vault path and password
# 3. NEVER commit the .env file or share it publicly
#
# ===============================

# Path to your test vault file (.vult)
# Can be absolute or relative to the project root
# Example: ./packages/sdk/tests/fixtures/vaults/my-test-vault.vult
TEST_VAULT_PATH=

# Vault password
# Use a strong password even for test vaults
TEST_VAULT_PASSWORD=

# ===============================
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
# ===============================
#
# 1. NEVER fund test vaults with large amounts
#    - Maximum recommended: $100 total across all chains
#    - Use minimal amounts for transaction tests ($5-10 per chain)
#
# 2. Use dedicated test vaults only
#    - Never use production vaults for testing
#    - Create separate vaults specifically for E2E tests
#
# 3. Keep vault files secure
#    - Store vault files outside of git
#    - Never share vault files or passwords
#    - Rotate test vaults periodically
#
# 4. Monitor test vault balances
#    - Check balances regularly for unexpected changes
#    - Set up alerts if balances drop unexpectedly
#
# 5. Read-only tests (default)
#    - Most E2E tests are read-only (balance checks, gas estimation)
#    - These tests work with zero balance and don't require funding
#
# 6. Transaction signing tests (Phase 4.2)
#    - Only enable if you need to test transaction preparation
#    - Requires small funding on test chains
#    - See SECURITY.md for detailed setup instructions
#
# ===============================

# Optional: Enable transaction preparation tests (requires funded vault)
# Leave empty or set to 'false' to run read-only tests only
# Set to 'true' only after reading SECURITY.md
ENABLE_TX_SIGNING_TESTS=false

# Optional: Maximum allowed total balance across all chains (USD)
# Safety check to prevent using production vaults accidentally
MAX_TEST_VAULT_BALANCE_USD=100
