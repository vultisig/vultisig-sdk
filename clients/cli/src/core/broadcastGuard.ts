/**
 * Broadcast dedupe guard for the direct `send` / `swap` CLI commands.
 *
 * The `agent ask` path already guards every broadcast against the persistent
 * journal (`clients/cli/src/agent/broadcastJournal.ts`) so a retry can't
 * re-broadcast an identical intent (audit F1/F14 — the #952/#927 work). The
 * direct `send` / `swap` verbs called `vault.send()` / `vault.swap()` straight
 * through and NEVER touched that journal, so a retried `send` double-spent
 * (audit P5-1, HIGH). This module wires the SAME exported helpers
 * (`assertNoRecentDuplicate` / `reserveBroadcast` / `recordBroadcast`) into
 * those commands so both paths share ONE journal file and dedupe against each
 * other.
 *
 * The intent basis here is the resolved {@link KeysignPayload} (send) or the
 * swap request (swap), namespaced by the vault's ECDSA public key so a shared
 * journal can't cross-match two different vaults.
 *
 * Cross-path parity: for a NATIVE / simple-EVM send the send-command basis
 * (owner=ecdsa, chain, to=recipient, value=base-unit amount, data=memo) lines up
 * field-for-field with the agent path's basis (executor.ts buildBroadcastIntent),
 * so a direct `send` and an identical `agent ask` dedupe against the ONE shared
 * journal. It does NOT line up for ERC-20 token sends (the agent path fingerprints
 * the on-chain tx — to=token contract, value=0, data=transfer calldata — whereas
 * the send command fingerprints the recipient + token amount) nor for swaps (the
 * swap intent is deliberately a coarse, retry-stable request descriptor). Those
 * cross-path cases are a MISSED dedup, not a double-spend: within each path token
 * sends and swaps still dedupe correctly. Full cross-path parity would require the
 * guard to move down into `vault.send()`/`vault.swap()` — see the residual note on
 * {@link guardedBroadcast}.

 * stable `max` sentinel: any `--max` send/swap of the same asset to the same

 * failed, or if a sibling process holds the reservation — UNLESS `force` is set.
 * Otherwise reserves the intent, runs `broadcast()`, records the resulting hash
 * to the journal so a later retry recognises it, and releases the reservation.
 *
 * Residual window (known limitation of the CLI-level wire): `broadcast()` is the
 * SDK's compound `vault.send()`/`vault.swap()`, which signs AND broadcasts on-chain
 * internally before returning a hash. If it broadcasts and then throws before
 * returning (a post-broadcast SDK step fails, or — for a multi-leg swap — the
 * ERC-20 approval broadcasts but the main leg then fails), nothing is journaled
 * and a fresh-process retry can re-broadcast. The reservation lock file survives a
 * hard crash for RESERVATION_STALE_MS (5 min) and covers the crash case, but not a
 * caught throw that exits cleanly. Closing this fully requires recording at each
 * SDK broadcast chokepoint (as the agent path does via recordBroadcastForTx) —
 * i.e. pushing the guard down into `vault.send()`/`vault.swap()`, a deliberately
 * deferred larger change. Follow-up: 070726-sdkcli2-01 residual (swap compound leg).
