# SECURITY WARNING: Storing passwords in .env files is convenient but less secure.
# Only use this for development/testing. For production, use a password manager or prompt entry.

# VAULT_PASSWORD=mypassword
#
# Option 2: Multiple vaults (space-separated "vaultName:password" or "vaultId:password" pairs)
# VAULT_PASSWORDS=MyVault:password123 WorkVault:password456
#
# Priority order: VAULT_PASSWORDS by name > VAULT_PASSWORDS by ID > VAULT_PASSWORD > prompt user

# Network (use testnet for development)
