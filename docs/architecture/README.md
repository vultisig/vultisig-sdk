## 🎨 Architecture Summary

### Current Architecture (Problems)

```
User can import 120+ items
  ↓
Too many choices, overwhelming
  ↓
Can't refactor internals (locked in by exports)
  ↓
Maintenance burden, documentation overhead
```

### Proposed Architecture (Solution)

```
User imports only Vultisig & Vault
  ↓
Clean, discoverable API
  ↓
Internal services coordinate operations
  ↓
Strategy pattern for chain-specific logic
  ↓
Easy to refactor, test, and extend
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Breaking Changes

**None for public API!** The refactoring is designed to maintain 100% backward compatibility with:
- VultisigSDK class (29 public methods)
- Vault class (24 public methods)
- Method signatures and return types
- Behavioral contracts

### Migration Strategy

**Phased approach with deprecation:**

1. **v2.x (Transition):**
   - All old exports continue to work
   - Deprecation warnings guide users
   - Full version cycle to migrate

2. **v3.0 (Clean API):**
   - Only 10-15 exports remain
   - Internal exports removed
   - Users had time to migrate

### Internal Changes Only

The refactoring changes **internal implementation**, not public API:

**What Users See (Unchanged):**
```typescript
const vault = await sdk.getVault('my-vault', 'password')
const address = await vault.address('Ethereum')
const balance = await vault.balance('Ethereum')
```

**What Changes (Internal):**
- How `vault.address()` is implemented internally
- How `vault.balance()` fetches data internally
- What's exported from index.ts
- Internal service organization
